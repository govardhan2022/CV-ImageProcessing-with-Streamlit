Developed an interactive web application using the Streamlit framework for real-time image processing and visualization. The application enables users to apply various computer vision techniques, including:

 1) ✅ Edge Detection – Implemented Canny Edge Detection and Difference of Gaussian (DoG) for identifying object boundaries.
 2) ✅ Corner Detection – Integrated techniques such as Harris Corner Detection to detect key points in an image.
 3) ✅ General Edge Detection – Applied gradient-based methods like Sobel and Laplacian filters for contour and feature extraction.

 

The application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and processing images in real-time, making it a valuable tool for educational and research purposes in computer vision.
